# random-int-arraylist

My solution for Chapter 7 Exercise 1 of “Introduction to Programming Using Java”.

Problem Description:
Write a subroutine that creates an ArrayList containing several different random integers
in the range from 1 up to some specified maximum. The number of integers and the
maximum allowed value for the integers should be parameters to the subroutine. Write a
main() routine to test your subroutine.
